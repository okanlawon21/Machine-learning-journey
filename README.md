#  Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning Journey!  
This repository is keeping record of my growth as a machine learning student and aspiring AI engineer. Here you'll find explorations, experiments, and projects as I deepen my understanding of data science, machine learning, and related technologies.

##  What’s Inside?

This repo includes:
- **Learning notebooks**: Mini-projects, research, and hands-on exercises across data preprocessing, Regression, classification, clustering, and more.
- **Project work**: Real-world datasets and solutions (like Titanic survival prediction, diabetes prediction, and more).
- **Experimentation**: Trials with various algorithms, feature engineering, and visualization techniques.

All code is written in Python, primarily with Jupyter Notebooks, driven by curiosity and the goal of turning data into meaningful insights.
